## Sequence A: Engineering / Professional Services
*Focus: Billable Hours & "Admin Creep"*

### Email 1: The "Billable Hour" Pain
**Subject:** Losing billable hours to admin?

Hi [Name],

I’m researching [Industry] firms and noticed [Company] has roughly [Employee Count] employees.

At that size, you likely have Project Managers spending 3-5 hours a week on repetitive admin tasks (reviews, reports, compliance) instead of billable work.

I’m a developer at **Abonmarche Consultants**. I built a workflow automation system that recovered **$576,000/year** in billable capacity for our 10 PMs.

I help other firms do the same.

Are you open to a 15-minute chat to see if we can find similar savings for you?

Best,

### Email 2: The Proof (Abonmarche)
**Subject:** 11 offices, 90 days, $576k

Hi [Name],

People usually ask: "Does this actually work at scale?"

At Abonmarche (200+ employees), we rolled out this automation across **11 offices** in just **90 days**.

It wasn't a massive IT overhaul. We automated **ONE** high-pain workflow: the civil engineering plan review process.

**The result:**
- 240+ billable hours recovered per month
- Consistent standards across all offices
- Happy PMs

I’d love to show you the ROI model we used. Here’s a link to my calendar:

### Email 3: The "No" Question
**Subject:** Giving up?

Hi [Name],

I haven't heard back, so I'm assuming "admin creep" isn't a major priority for [Company] right now.

I won't follow up again. If you ever want to see how we recovered those hours, the door is open.

All the best,

Jonah

## Sequence B: Multi-Location Businesses
*Focus: Consistency & Scale*

### Email 1: The "11 Offices" Hook
**Subject:** Consistency across [Company] offices?

Hi [Name],

I noticed [Company] has offices in [Location 1] and [Location 2].

I know the pain of trying to keep processes consistent across multiple locations. I’m a developer at **Abonmarche** (11 offices), and we used to struggle with inconsistent review standards.

I implemented an automated workflow that standardized our review process across all 11 offices in **90 days**—saving **$576k/year** in the process.

Is process consistency a challenge for you right now?

Best,

Jonah Knip

### Email 2: The Logic
**Subject:** One workflow, scaled

Hi [Name],

The mistake most multi-office firms make is trying to change *everything* at once.

At Abonmarche, we fixed **ONE** workflow first (plan reviews).
We proved the ROI ($48k/month savings).
Then we scaled it to the other offices.

If you have one standardized process that is eating up time (reports, data entry, compliance), we can likely automate it in roughly 30 days.

Are you free **Tuesday afternoon** to discuss?
