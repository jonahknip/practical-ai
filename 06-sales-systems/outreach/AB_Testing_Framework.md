# A/B Testing Framework
*Don't guess. Test.*

## 1. What to Test (Variables)
*Test ONE variable at a time. If you change Subject + Body, you won't know what worked.*

### A. Subject Lines (The Open Rate)
*   **Test:** "Pain Point" vs. "Curiosity"
    *   *A:* Losing billable hours?
    *   *B:* Quick question about [Company]
*   **Metric:** Open Rate.

### B. The Proof Point (The Reply Rate)
*   **Test:** "Dollar Amount" vs. "Hours Saved"
    *   *A:* Saved $576k/year.
    *   *B:* Recovered 240 hours/month.
*   **Metric:** Positive Reply Rate.

### C. The Call to Action (The Conversion)
*   **Test:** "Hard Ask" vs. "Soft Ask"
    *   *A:* Can we chat Tuesday at 2pm?
    *   *B:* Open to seeing the math?
*   **Metric:** Meetings Booked.

## 2. Sample Size
*   Don't make decisions after 5 emails.
*   **Minimum:** Send 20 emails of Version A and 20 emails of Version B.
*   **Ideal:** 50 of each.

---

## 3. How to Track (Simple)
*Use your Tracking Spreadsheet.*

**Experiment 1: Subject Lines**
*   **Batch A (20 sends):** "Losing billable hours?" -> 12 Opens (60%)
*   **Batch B (20 sends):** "Quick question" -> 8 Opens (40%)
*   **Winner:** Batch A. Use that subject line for the next 100 emails.

## 4. Iteration Schedule
*   **Week 1:** Test Subject Lines. Find the winner.
*   **Week 2:** Test Opening Hook (Personalization style).
*   **Week 3:** Test CTA (Call link vs. Reply).
*   **Week 4:** Review all data. Build the "Master Sequence" from the winners.
