## VERSION A: DIRECT RESULTS (Lead with Proof)
*Best for: Mid-size companies, Ops Leaders, high-pain signals.*

**Subject:** $576K saved in 90 days

Hi [Name],

Quick intro - I'm Jonah Knip. At **Abonmarche** (200+ employees, 11 offices), I automated one workflow and saved the company **$576K annually** in 90 days.

I saw you're leading operations at [Company]. If you have workflows eating billable hours, I'd love to show you what we did.

Would you be open to a quick 15-min call this week? No pitch, just sharing what worked.

Best,

Jonah

P.S. Here's my calendar if easier: **calendly.com/jonahknip/discovery**

## VERSION B: RELATABLE STORY (Lead with Positioning)
*Best for: Smaller companies, non-technical leaders, "AI skeptics".*

**Subject:** Not a developer, but saved my company $576K

Hi [Name],

I'm not a "real developer." I'm a GIS Technician who taught myself to use AI tools to solve problems at work.

**Result:** Saved my company $576K in 90 days by automating one workflow and training 10 non-technical PMs to do the same.

I noticed [something specific about their company/recent post]. If [Company] has repetitive workflows burning time, I'd love to share what worked for us.

15-min call this week?

Best,

Jonah

## VERSION C: PROBLEM-FOCUSED (Lead with Pain)
*Best for: Professional Services firms, efficiency/capacity issues.*

**Subject:** Billable hours being eaten by admin work?

Hi [Name],

Quick question: How much time does your team spend on repetitive admin tasks vs actual billable work?

At **Abonmarche**, our PMs were losing **4 billable hours per project** to design reviews. We automated it and recovered **240-320 hours per month**.

If [Company] has similar workflows, I'd love to show you what we did. It took 90 days and saved $576K annually.

15-min call to explore?

Best,

Jonah

## VERSION D: CURIOSITY GAP (Lead with Question)
*Best for: Analytical leaders, "thought leadership" engagers.*

**Subject:** One workflow = $576K?

Hi [Name],

What if I told you automating ONE workflow at your company could recover 6 figures annually?

That's what happened at Abonmarche. We picked the civil engineering design review process - one repetitive workflow across 11 offices. 90 days later: **$576K in annual savings.**

Curious if this approach could work at [Company]?

15-min call this week to explore?

Best,

Jonah

## VERSION E: SOCIAL PROOF (Lead with Scale)
*Best for: Multi-location firms, larger (100+) companies.*

**Subject:** Scaled across 11 offices in 90 days

Hi [Name],

I recently led an AI implementation across **11 offices** at Abonmarche (200+ employees) that saved **$576K annually**.

The interesting part: We automated just **ONE** workflow, trained 10 non-technical Project Managers to use the tools themselves, and scaled it in 90 days.

Given [Company]'s [multi-location/size/complexity], I thought this approach might be relevant.

Worth a 15-min conversation?

Best,

Jonah
