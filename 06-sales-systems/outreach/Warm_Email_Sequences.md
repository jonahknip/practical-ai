### Email 1: The "What I'm Up To" (Reconnection)
**Subject:** Life after [Previous Company/Context] / Quick update

Hi [Name],

Hope you’re doing well. It’s been a while since [Context/Last Interaction].

I wanted to reach out because I recently launched **PRACTICAL AI Framework**.

I’m taking the work I did at **Abonmarche** (automating engineering workflows across 11 offices) and helping other firms do the same. We focused on recovering billable hours from admin tasks and saved roughly **$576k/year** from just one workflow.

I’m looking to chat with a few folks in [Industry] to see if they’re seeing the same "billable hour leakage" we saw.

Any chance you have 10 minutes to catch up next week?

Best,

Jonah

### Email 2: The Value Add (3 Days Later)
**Subject:** One workflow example (Abonmarche case study)

Hi [Name],

Quick follow-up—I thought you might find this interesting given your role at [Company].

This is the exact breakdown of how we recovered **240+ billable hours/month** at Abonmarche by automating the **civil engineering plan review** process:

It wasn't about "replacing humans." It was about letting PMs be engineers instead of admin assistants.

Does [Company] struggle with similar repetitive review cycles?

Best,

Jonah

### Email 3: The Simple Ask (5 Days Later)
**Subject:** Quick chat?

Hi [Name],

I promise I won't keep bugging you!

I’m putting together a few pilots for [Month]. If you’re open to it, I’d love to show you the math on how this could work for one of your workflows.

Here’s my calendar: **calendly.com/jonahknip/discovery**

If not, no worries at all—let’s definitely stay in touch.

### Email 1: Thanks for connecting
**Subject:** Connecting from LinkedIn / Question about [Company]

Hi [Name],

Thanks for connecting on LinkedIn.

I see you’re managing [Role/Team] at [Company]. I’m reaching out because I’m a Software Developer who specializes in helping firms like yours recover billable hours.

At **Abonmarche**, I built an automation for our plan review process that saved **$576k/year** in lost capacity.

I’m curious—do your PMs spend a lot of time on repetitive admin work during reviews?

Best,

Jonah Knip

### Email 2: The Proof (4 Days Later)
**Subject:** How we saved $576k (not a typo)

Hi [Name],

Regarding my last note—I know "$576k savings" sounds like consultant fluff.

It’s actually simple math:
We had **10 PMs** spending **4 hours/week** on review admin. That’s roughly **$48k/month** in billable capacity.

We automated the repetitive checks (compliance, formatting, logs) and gave that time back to the engineers.

I wrote up a short case study on exactly how we did it across **11 offices**:
**[Link to Case Study]**

Worth a quick chat to see if we can do the same for you?

Hi [Name],

Last try here.

If you’re losing billable hours to admin work, I can help you find them. I’m currently booking discovery calls for [Month] pilots.
