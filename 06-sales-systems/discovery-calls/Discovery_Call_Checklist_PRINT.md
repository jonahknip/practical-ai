## 7. OBJECTION RESPONSES

**"That's expensive"**
→ *"At Abonmarche, we spent $[investment] and saved $576K annually. Payback was in weeks. Based on your numbers ($[their cost]), you'd break even in [X weeks]. Does that payback period work for you?"*

**"We need to think about it"**
→ *"Totally understand. What specific questions can I answer? And what's your thinking timeline? Happy to send over some materials while you consider."*

**"We tried AI before, didn't work"**
→ *"I hear that a lot. What did you try? Most companies jump to solutions before understanding the problem. That's why I start with ONE workflow, prove ROI, then scale."*

**"Our work is too specialized"**
→ *"That's what Abonmarche said. Engineering plan reviews across 11 offices—very specialized. Turned out the 'specialized' parts were 20%; the 80% repetitive admin is what we automated."*

**"We don't have time to implement"**
→ *"That's the beauty of this approach. 30-day pilot means 4 weeks from start to seeing results. And your team learns to do it themselves, so you're not dependent on me long-term."*
