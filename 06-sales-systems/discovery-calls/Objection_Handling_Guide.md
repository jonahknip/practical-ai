# Objection Handling Guide
*Your secret weapon: You aren't a sales guy. You are a developer who actually did this.*

---

## 1. "That sounds expensive / We don't have the budget."
**Underlying Concern:** They don't see the value yet.
**Your Response:**
"I totally get that. But let's look at the math we just did. You're currently 'spending' **$200k** a year on this problem in lost billable hours. That money is already leaving the building.
My pilot is **$15k** one-time.
Ideally, we stop the $200k leak.
If you had a hole in your roof costing you $200k in damage, would $15k to patch it feel expensive?"

## 2. "We are too busy to implement this right now."
**Underlying Concern:** This will be another project *I* have to manage.
**Your Response:**
"That’s exactly why we use the PRACTICAL framework. I know your PMs are swamped—I watched ours drown in work at Abonmarche.
I do 95% of the heavy lifting.
I need **one hour** a week from one 'Champion' on your team to verify the output. That's it.
I build it, I test it, I train them. You just get the time back."

## 3. "Our work is too specialized / heavily regulated for AI."
**Underlying Concern:** AI will hallucinate and get us sued.
**Your Response:**
"You're right. We absolutely **cannot** have AI making engineering judgments.
At Abonmarche, we didn't use AI to *design* the bridges. We used it to handle the *paperwork* around the design—the checklists, the formatting, the standard compliance text.
The engineer is always the 'Human in the Loop.' We just make them faster."

## 4. "We want to try to figure this out internally first."
**Underlying Concern:** Why pay you when I have ChatGPT?
**Your Response:**
"I respect that. Honestly, you probably could figure it out.
But ask yourself: Do you have a developer on staff who has 3 months of free time to learn the API engineering, prompt chaining, and security protocols?
I've already spent the year figuring out the edge cases across 11 offices.
You can pay tuition to learn it yourself, or you can pay for the blueprint that already works. Which gets you the ROI faster?"

## 5. "It won't work across all our offices/teams."
**Underlying Concern:** Standardization is hard.
**Your Response:**
"This was my biggest headache at Abonmarche too. 11 offices, 11 different ways of doing things.
The key isn't the software; it's the rollout plan.
We start with ONE office or ONE team. We nail the process there. Then, those people become the evangelists for the other offices. I have a specific 'Champion Playbook' for exactly this."

## 6. "Can you just consult for a few hours?"
**Underlying Concern:** Risk mitigation / low commitment.
**Your Response:**
"I've found that hourly consulting usually results in a nice PDF report that sits in a drawer.
I sell **outcomes**. The 'Quick Win Pilot' ensures you actually get a working automation that saves money. I'd rather deliver a result than bill you for advice."
