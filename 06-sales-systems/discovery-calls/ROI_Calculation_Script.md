# ROI Calculation Script
*The goal is not precise accounting. The goal is to show the "Cost of Inaction."*

---

## 1. The Setup (Getting Permission)
"Before we talk about solutions, I want to make sure the problem is actually expensive enough to be worth solving. Mind if we do some quick back-of-the-napkin math?"

## 2. The Inputs (Ask these exactly)
*   **Variable A (Volume):** "How many hours a week does one person spend on this?"
*   **Variable B (Headcount):** "And how many people are doing it?"
*   **Variable C (Value):** "What's a conservative billable hourly rate for that role? Let's keep it low so we aren't exaggerating."

## 3. The Live Calculation (Speak aloud while calculating)
"Okay, let's look at what that means annually."

*   "You have **[B]** people..."
*   "Spending **[A]** hours a week..."
*   "That is **[A x B]** hours burned every single week."
*   "Multiply that by **50 weeks** a year... that's **[Annual Hours]** hours."
*   "At **$[C]** per hour..."

*(Pause for effect)*

"That is **$[Total]** per year in billable capacity getting stuck in admin work."

## 4. The Contextualization (The "Abonmarche Anchor")
"To give you some context, when I ran this analysis at Abonmarche, we found 10 PMs were burning about $576,000 a year on review coordination.
We invested in a 90-day implementation and recovered that capacity.
Right now, you're looking at a **$[Total]** opportunity cost every year you *don't* fix this."

## 5. The Close (The "No-Brainer")
"If I could automate even 50% of that—so let's say we recover **$[Total / 2]**—would that be worth a **$15k** one-time investment?"

## Example Scenarios

### Scenario A: Mid-Sized Engineering Firm
*   **Input:** 5 PMs, 4 hours/week, $200/hr.
*   **Math:** 20 hours/week * 50 weeks = 1,000 hours/year.
*   **Cost:** 1,000 hours * $200 = **$200,000/year.**
*   **Pitch:** "You are losing $200k. The Pilot is $15k. That's a 13x ROI in Year 1."

### Scenario B: Small Architecture Studio
*   **Input:** 3 Architects, 5 hours/week (CA logs), $150/hr.
*   **Math:** 15 hours/week * 50 weeks = 750 hours/year.
*   **Cost:** 750 hours * $150 = **$112,500/year.**
*   **Pitch:** "You're losing $112k. Even if we only save half, that's $56k. The Pilot pays for itself in 3 months."
