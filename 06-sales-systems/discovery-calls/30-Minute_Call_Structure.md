# 30-Minute Discovery Call Structure
**Goal:** Disqualify bad leads early, or qualify good leads by calculating their "Cost of Inaction."

---

## Part 1: The Frame (Minutes 0-3)
*Establish authority immediately. Stop them from treating you like a "vendor."*

**You:** "Thanks for making time. I want to be respectful of your schedule.
The goal for today is simple: I want to learn a bit about your current workflows to see if there's any obvious 'billable hour leakage' we can fix.
If I think I can help, I'll show you how we did it at Abonmarche. If not, I'll point you in the right direction. Does that sound fair?"

*(Wait for Yes)*

**You:** "Great. I did a little research, and I saw [mention 1 thing from checklist]. It looks like you're dealing with [volume/complexity].
Just so I have context—what specifically sparked you to book this call *now*?"

---

## Part 2: Discovery & The "Pain Hunt" (Minutes 3-20)
*Do not pitch AI. Ask about their day-to-day friction.*

**The Transition:**
"So, my background is actually as a Software Developer inside a 200-person engineering firm. I spent the last year automating workflows for our Project Managers.
I'm curious..."

**Ask 3-4 Deep Dive Questions (See Master List):**
1.  "Where are your highest-paid people spending time *not* doing high-value work?"
2.  "If you track your project phases (30/60/90%), where does the bottleneck usually happen?"
3.  "Walk me through your [Process Name]. When a PM gets a set of plans, what exactly happens?"

** The "Ledger" Moment (CRITICAL):**
*As they talk, you must extract these 3 numbers:*
1.  **Who** does the work? (e.g., "Senior PMs")
2.  **How long** does it take? (e.g., "4 hours a week")
3.  **How many** people do it? (e.g., "About 6 of us")

## Part 3: The "Napkin Math" Calculation (Minutes 20-26)
*Mirror their problem back to them with a dollar sign attached.*

**You:** "Okay, can I pause you there? I want to make sure I understand the scope of this."

**You (Doing the math live):**
"You mentioned you have **6 PMs**.
And they are spending about **4 hours a week** on [Task X].
Conservatively, let's say their billable value is **$200/hour**.

That’s $800 a week, per PM.
Times 6 PMs... that’s **$4,800 a week** in lost capacity.
Over a year... that is roughly **$250,000** tied up in [Task X].

Does that number sound about right, or am I overestimating?"

*(Let them sit with that number. Usually, they say "Actually, it's probably more.")*

**The Proof Drop:**
"This is exactly what we saw at Abonmarche. We had 10 PMs losing time on plan reviews. We automated that one workflow, implemented it in 90 days, and recovered **$576,000 a year** in billable capacity. It sounds like you have a very similar opportunity here."

---

## Part 4: Next Steps & CTA (Minutes 26-30)
*Do not sell the full project. Sell the next step.*

**If they are NOT a fit:**
"Honestly, [Name], based on [Reason], I don't think the PRACTICAL framework is the right fit right now. You might be better off with [Alternative Solution]."

**If they ARE a fit:**
"Look, the math is pretty clear. You're losing ~$20k/month on this.
I don't want to sell you a giant consulting package. I prefer to start with a **Quick Win Pilot**.

We take that ONE workflow we just discussed.
I automate it in 30 days.
We prove the ROI specifically for your team.
It costs **$15k**, which is less than one month of the money you're currently losing on the problem.

Does it make sense to scope that out?"

---

## Part 5: The "Homework"
"I'll send you a summary of the math we just did.
All I need from you is to send me [1 example document/file] so I can confirm the complexity. Can you get that to me by tomorrow?"
