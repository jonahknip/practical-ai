# Pre-Call Research Checklist
**Time Investment:** 5-10 Minutes Maximum
**Goal:** Find evidence of "billable hour leakage" before you say hello.

---

## 1. The LinkedIn Scan (3 Minutes)
*Look for evidence of scale and complexity.*

*   **Company Page:**
    *   [ ] **Employee Count:** Are they in the "Sweet Spot" (20-200)?
    *   [ ] **Locations:** Do they have multiple offices? (Matches your Abonmarche 11-office story).
    *   [ ] **Recent Posts:** Are they celebrating new project wins? (Means they are busy/stressed).
    *   [ ] **Hiring:** Are they hiring "Project Managers," "Engineers," or "Coordinators"? (Sign of capacity constraints).

*   **The Prospect's Profile:**
    *   [ ] **Tenure:** How long have they been there? (New = wants to make a mark. Old = knows where the bodies are buried).
    *   [ ] **Background:** Technical or Business? (Technical = talk workflow. Business = talk margins).
    *   [ ] **Activity:** Have they posted about "busy season," "deadlines," or "hiring"?

## 2. The Website "Process" Hunt (2 Minutes)
*Look for keywords that imply repetitive documentation.*

*   [ ] **Services Page:** Do they mention "Feasibility Studies," "Code Compliance," "Permitting," "Environmental Assessments"? (These are paperwork-heavy).
*   [ ] **Case Studies:** Look at the *type* of projects. High volume of small projects? Or massive complex infrastructure?
    *   *High Volume* = Needs automation for speed.
    *   *High Complexity* = Needs automation for compliance/accuracy.

## 3. The "Napkin Math" Prep (1 Minute)
*Have a rough hypothesis ready.*

*   **Hypothesis:** "Based on their size (50 people), they probably have ~5-8 PMs. If they operate like Abonmarche, they are likely wasting $200k+ on admin."
*   **Industry Customization:**
    *   *Civil Engineering:* Focus on Plan Reviews / Permitting.
    *   *Architecture:* Focus on Construction Administration (CA) logs / Spec writing.
    *   *Environmental:* Focus on Field Reports / Phase I ESA generation.
    *   *General Consulting:* Focus on Weekly Status Reports / Proposal generation.

## 4. The "Icebreaker" Hook
*Don't talk about the weather. Talk about their business.*

*   **Bad:** "I saw you went to [University]."
*   **Good:** "I saw you just won the [Project Name] contract. That looks massive—how are you handling the review volume on that?"
*   **Good:** "I noticed you opened a new office in [City]. When we expanded offices at Abonmarche, keeping our review standards consistent was a nightmare. How are you guys managing the cross-office QC?"
