# PRACTICAL AI IMPLEMENTATION
## One-Page Service Overview

---

### STOP DREAMING ABOUT AI. START SAVING 60% OF YOUR TEAM'S TIME.

The PRACTICAL AI Adoption Framework™ delivers measurable results in 90 days—built for real companies with legacy systems, limited budgets, and zero patience for consultant BS.

---

## THE PROBLEM YOU'RE FACING

Your team wastes 20-40% of their time on:
- Repetitive report generation
- Manual data entry and formatting
- Copy-paste between systems
- Email responses to common questions
- Meeting summaries and documentation

**This isn't a people problem. It's a process problem that AI can solve.**

---

## WHY TRADITIONAL AI CONSULTING FAILS YOU

❌ 6-12 month "transformation" timelines  
❌ Requires complete tech stack overhauls  
❌ Enterprise-grade complexity for mid-sized budgets  
❌ Creates consultant dependency  
❌ Vague ROI promises

**You need results now, not roadmaps for someday.**

---

## THE PRACTICAL APPROACH

✅ Working solutions in 30 days  
✅ Integrates with existing systems (yes, even Excel)  
✅ Built for companies with 20-200 employees  
✅ We train your team to own it  
✅ Guaranteed ROI in 6 months

## HOW IT WORKS: THE PRACTICAL FRAMEWORK™

**P** - PROCESS AUDIT  
Find the pain before prescribing the pill. We shadow your team to identify real bottlenecks.

**R** - ROI REALITY CHECK  
No bullshit math. If it doesn't pay for itself in 6 months, we don't recommend it.

**A** - ACCESSIBLE ENTRY POINT  
Start small, prove value in 30 days, then scale fast.

**C** - CHAMPION CULTIVATION  
Your team leads adoption. We build a peer-to-peer support system.

**T** - TOOL-AGNOSTIC SOLUTIONS  
We recommend what works, not what's trendy or pays us commissions.

**I** - ITERATIVE IMPLEMENTATION  
2-week sprints. Fail fast, learn faster, succeed sooner.

**C** - CHANGE MANAGEMENT BUILT-IN  
Adoption is 20% technology, 80% psychology. We handle both.

**A** - ANALYTICS & ACCOUNTABILITY  
Measure everything. Prove value continuously, not just at project end.

**L** - LEGACY INTEGRATION  
Work with your existing systems, not against them. No forced overhauls.
