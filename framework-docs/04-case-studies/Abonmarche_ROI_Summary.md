- **Implementation timeline:** **90 days** (pilot → rollout)

---

## Baseline (Before AI)

**Time lost per project (non-billable admin):**
- PM: 1 hr/phase × 4 phases = **4 hrs/project**
- Engineer: 1 hr/phase × 4 phases = **4 hrs/project**
- **Total: 8 hrs/project**

**Rates:**
- PM: **$225/hr**
- Engineer: **$150/hr**

**Cost impact per project (before AI):**
- PM: 4 × $225 = **$900**
- Engineer: 4 × $150 = **$600**
- **Total: $1,500/project**

---

## Results (After AI) — Use Case Numbers

### Per-project impact

- **Time saved:** **6–8 billable hours recovered per project**
- PM time saved: **3–4 hrs × $225/hr = $675–$900**
- Engineer time saved: **3–4 hrs × $150/hr = $450–$600**
- **Total per project:** **$1,200 average savings (conservative)**

### Monthly impact

**Assumptions:** 10 PMs, ~4 projects/PM/month → **40 projects/month**

- **40 projects × $1,200 = $48,000/month**
- **240–320 billable hours recovered/month**

### Annual impact

- **$48,000/month × 12 = $576,000/year** (ONE workflow)
- **2,880–3,840 billable hours recovered/year**

---

## Investment (Year 1 Estimate)

**Assumptions:**
- 12-week implementation window
- Blended internal fully-loaded rate for implementation labor: **$110/hr**

**Cost model:**
- Discovery & design: 2 wks × 25 hrs/wk × $110/hr = **$5,500**
- Development & implementation: 6 wks × 25 hrs/wk × $110/hr = **$16,500**
- Rollout/iteration/measurement/docs: 4 wks × 20 hrs/wk × $110/hr = **$8,800**
- Training time (opportunity cost): 10 PMs × 1.5 hrs × $225/hr = **$3,375**
- Tools/software: $250/mo × 12 = **$3,000**

**Total Year 1 investment:**
- **$37,175 (rounded: $37,000)**

## Payback & ROI

### Gross (capacity value)
- Annual benefit: **$576,000**
- Year 1 ROI: (576,000 − 37,000) ÷ 37,000 × 100 = **~1,457%**
- Payback (gross): 37,000 ÷ 48,000 = **~0.77 months**

### Conservative (realized) — recommended for credibility
Recovered hours don’t always convert 1:1 into incremental billings immediately (capacity utilization). Conservative assumption: **40%** utilization in Year 1.

- Realized annual benefit: 576,000 × 0.40 = **$230,400**
- Realized monthly benefit: 48,000 × 0.40 = **$19,200/month**
- Payback: 37,000 ÷ 19,200 = **~1.93 months**
- Year 1 ROI: (230,400 − 37,000) ÷ 37,000 × 100 = **~523%**

### 3-year net benefit (gross)
- 3-year savings: 3 × 576,000 = **$1,728,000**
- Net (subtract Year 1 investment): 1,728,000 − 37,000 = **$1,691,000 (~$1.7M)**

---

## Per-PM Economics

- Value per PM per month (gross): 48,000 ÷ 10 = **$4,800/month**
- Hours recovered per PM per month: (240–320) ÷ 10 = **24–32 hours/month**
- Value per PM per year: 576,000 ÷ 10 = **$57,600/year**
- Investment per PM (Year 1): 37,000 ÷ 10 = **$3,700**

## One-Workflow Emphasis

This $576K/year value is from **automating ONE workflow** (civil plan reviews) for 10 PMs.

The same approach can be replicated across other workflows (reports, document prep, compliance checking, client comms) for compounding ROI.
