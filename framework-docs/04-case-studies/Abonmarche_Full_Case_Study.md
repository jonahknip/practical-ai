## 1) COMPANY BACKGROUND

Abonmarche Consultants is a 200+ person professional services firm with 11 offices, delivering civil, environmental, transportation, and GIS consulting.

Like most multi-office engineering organizations, Abonmarche runs many repeatable workflows—especially around deliverables, reviews, documentation, compliance, and coordination. Small inefficiencies inside these workflows compound quickly because they repeat across projects, phases, and offices.

This case study covers **ONE workflow implementation** at Abonmarche: **civil engineering plan review automation**.

---

## 2) THE CHALLENGE — ONE SPECIFIC WORKFLOW

### Focus: Civil engineering design review (30%, 60%, 90%, final/100%)

Civil projects move through standard review phases (30% / 60% / 90% / Final). At each phase, PMs and engineers must:
- perform repetitive compliance checks
- create and reconcile markups/corrections
- coordinate back-and-forth clarifications
- complete administrative review tasks

These steps are important—but much of the effort is **standardizable** and repeated across projects.

### The pain (before AI)

**Time lost per project (before AI):**
- PM time: **1 billable hour per review phase × 4 phases = 4 hours**
- Engineer time: **1 billable hour per review phase × 4 phases = 4 hours**
- **Total: 8 billable hours per project** spent on repetitive review administration

**Cost impact per project (before AI):**
- PM billable rate: **$225/hr** → 4 × $225 = **$900**
- Engineer billable rate: **$150/hr** → 4 × $150 = **$600**
- **Total wasted per project: $1,500** of non-billable administrative time

**Scale of impact:**
- Users affected: **10 PMs** across **11 offices** (plus engineers on their projects)
- Average throughput: **~4 projects per PM per month** in active review cycles
- **40 projects/month** × $1,200–$1,500 per project = substantial recurring loss

### Why it mattered

For professional services firms, **billable hours are the business model**.

When experienced PMs and engineers are spending hours on repetitive review admin work:
- the firm loses revenue opportunity (hours that could be billed)
- projects slow down due to review bottlenecks
- consistency suffers across offices
- highly-skilled staff spend time on administrative tasks instead of engineering decisions

And importantly: **this was only ONE workflow**. Abonmarche has many other repeatable workflows with similar patterns.

## 3) THE PRACTICAL APPROACH

**Role:** Jonah Knip — Software Developer, Digital Solutions

The implementation followed the PRACTICAL AI Framework principle: **start with one high-impact workflow, prove ROI quickly, then replicate.**

### Discovery (Weeks 1–2)
- Shadowed PMs through the full review lifecycle (30% / 60% / 90% / Final)
- Mapped the workflow end-to-end: inputs, outputs, decisions, handoffs, and friction points
- Identified repeatable, automatable tasks at each phase (especially compliance and standard checks)
- Defined success metrics in the language leadership cares about: **billable hours recovered**

### Pilot (Weeks 3–6)
- Built an AI-powered plan review assistant for the civil engineering review process
- Piloted with **2–3 PM champions**
- Measured actual time saved at each review phase
- Iterated based on real project review feedback (not hypothetical use)

### Rollout (Weeks 7–12)
- Expanded to all **10 PMs** across offices
- Standardized the usage pattern so reviews were consistent across locations
- Trained champions to support peer adoption
- Documented the workflow and the “how-to” so the system could be sustained

---

## 4) THE SOLUTION

### AI-powered civil engineering design review automation

The delivered solution was an **AI-assisted plan review workflow** designed around how PMs and engineers already work during 30/60/90/Final reviews.

**What it automated/streamlined:**
- Repetitive compliance checks at each phase
- Standard review markup and correction workflows
- Administrative review tasks that were consistent across projects

**What it improved:**
- Standardized review standards across **11 offices**
- Faster feedback loops so engineers didn’t hit standstills
- Less time spent re-checking the same requirements phase after phase

**How adoption worked:**
- PM champions served as internal enablement leads
- Training focused on “use it on every review phase” (30/60/90/Final), not occasional usage

**Critical emphasis:** This is **ONE workflow** implementation. It proves the approach works in a real multi-office environment—and provides a repeatable blueprint to scale.

## 5) IMPLEMENTATION TIMELINE (90 DAYS)

- **Weeks 1–2:** Process mapping, shadow PMs, identify automation points
- **Weeks 3–4:** Build solution, test with 2 champion PMs
- **Weeks 5–6:** Refine based on real project reviews
- **Weeks 7–9:** Roll out to remaining 8 PMs
- **Weeks 10–12:** Measure results, optimize, document

**Result:** a proven system from pilot to full rollout in **90 days**.

---

## 6) RESULTS (using provided numbers)

### Per-project impact

**Time saved:** **6–8 billable hours recovered per project**

- PM time: **3–4 hours × $225/hr = $675–$900 saved**
- Engineer time: **3–4 hours × $150/hr = $450–$600 saved**
- **Total per project: $1,200 average savings (conservative)**

> Note: The “before” estimate was 8 hours wasted per project. The implementation consistently recovered most of that time (6–8 hours), depending on review complexity.

### Monthly impact (10 PMs, ~40 projects/month)

- **40 projects/month × $1,200 = $48,000/month** recovered
- **240–320 billable hours recovered per month**

This recovered capacity can be reinvested in:
- billable client work
- higher-quality engineering decisions
- faster deliverable turnarounds

### Annual impact

## 7) CRITICAL EMPHASIS — THIS IS ONE WORKFLOW

**This $576K annual savings represents automation of ONE workflow at Abonmarche:**

> the civil engineering design review process affecting 10 Project Managers.

Abonmarche has **dozens of other repetitive workflows** that could be automated, such as:
- Report generation
- Data entry and processing
- Client communications
- Document preparation
- Compliance checking
- And many more…

This implementation proves the **PRACTICAL AI Framework** works in a real environment (**11 offices, 200+ employees**) and can be replicated across other workflows for compounding ROI.

## 8) CLIENT TESTIMONIAL (realistic, anonymized)

> “I used to lose about four hours per project just coordinating the review cycle—tracking standards, repeating checks, and pushing markups back and forth. Now that time goes into actual engineering decisions, and our reviews are consistent across offices. We’re delivering faster, and I can take on more projects without feeling like the process is fighting me.”

## CALCULATIONS REQUIRED

### 1) Implementation investment (Year 1 estimate)

Below is a realistic internal-style estimate (time + enablement + tools). You can adjust the hourly rate to match your preferred model.

**Assumptions:**
- Implementation length: 12 weeks
- Blended implementation labor rate (internal fully-loaded): **$110/hr** (conservative)

**Discovery & design:**
- 2 weeks × ~25 hrs/week × $110/hr ≈ **$5,500**

**Development & implementation:**
- 6 weeks × ~25 hrs/week × $110/hr ≈ **$16,500**

**Rollout, iteration, measurement, documentation:**
- 4 weeks × ~20 hrs/week × $110/hr ≈ **$8,800**

**Training time (opportunity cost):**
- 10 PMs × 1.5 hrs × $225/hr ≈ **$3,375**

**Tools/software:**
- ~$250/month × 12 ≈ **$3,000**

**Total Year 1 investment (estimated):**
- **$5,500 + $16,500 + $8,800 + $3,375 + $3,000 = $37,175**
- **Rounded: ~$37,000**

### 2) ROI calculation

**Gross annualized benefit (capacity value):**
- Annual savings: **$576,000**

**Conservative realization assumption (recommended for credibility):**
Recovered hours do not always convert 1:1 into incremental billings immediately (pipeline, scheduling, seasonality). A conservative Year 1 utilization assumption is **40%**.

- **Conservative realized Year 1 benefit:** $576,000 × 0.40 = **$230,400**

**Payback period (conservative realized):**
- Monthly realized benefit: $48,000 × 0.40 = **$19,200/month**
- Payback: $37,000 ÷ $19,200 ≈ **1.93 months**

**Year 1 ROI (conservative realized):**
- ROI = (Savings − Investment) ÷ Investment × 100
- ROI = ($230,400 − $37,000) ÷ $37,000 × 100 ≈ **523%**

**Year 1 ROI (gross capacity value, upside):**
- ROI = ($576,000 − $37,000) ÷ $37,000 × 100 ≈ **1,457%**

**3-year ROI / net benefit (gross capacity value):**
- 3-year savings: 3 × $576,000 = **$1,728,000**
- 3-year net (subtract Year 1 investment only): $1,728,000 − $37,000 = **$1,691,000 (~$1.7M)**

> If you want a stricter model, include ongoing tool costs in Years 2–3 as well. The ROI remains very large.

### 3) Per-PM economics

- Savings per month (gross): $48,000/month ÷ 10 PMs = **$4,800/month per PM**
- Hours recovered per PM per month: (240–320 hours/month) ÷ 10 = **24–32 hours per PM per month**
- Value per PM annually: $576,000 ÷ 10 = **$57,600/year per PM**
- Investment per PM (Year 1): $37,000 ÷ 10 = **$3,700 per PM**
