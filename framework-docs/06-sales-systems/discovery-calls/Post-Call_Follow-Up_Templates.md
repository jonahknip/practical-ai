# Post-Call Follow-Up Templates

## 1. Immediate Thank You (Send within 1 hour)
**Subject:** The math on [Workflow Name] ($200k opportunity?)

Hi [Name],

Great speaking with you today.

To recap the "napkin math" we did:
*   **The Workflow:** [Workflow Name]
*   **The Cost:** [X] hours/week across [Y] people
*   **The Leak:** Roughly **$[Annual Amount]** per year in billable capacity.

As discussed, I think we can recover a huge chunk of that using the **Quick Win Pilot**.

I’m putting together a formal summary of that ROI calculation for you to share with your team. I’ll have that over to you by tomorrow morning.

Best,

Jonah Knip

**[Link to Proposal/ROI PDF]**

**The Highlights:**
*   **Goal:** Automate [Workflow] to recover billable hours.

I've outlined the exact schedule in the PDF.

## 3. The "Soft No" / Timing Issue (Keep Door Open)
**Subject:** Re: Timing for [Workflow] automation

Hi [Name],

Totally understand. Timing is everything.

I'll put a note to check back in with you in **[Month]** to see if things have settled down.

In the meantime, since you mentioned [Specific Pain Point], I thought you might find this case study interesting—it shows exactly how we handled that specific issue at Abonmarche: [Link].

Good luck with the [Project they mentioned] deadline!

Best,

Jonah

## 4. The "Ghosting" Follow-Up (Send after 3 days of silence)
**Subject:** Any thoughts on the ROI numbers?

Hi [Name],

Just bubbling this to the top of your inbox.

I was thinking more about our conversation regarding [Workflow]. Even if we don't do the full pilot right now, have you considered just standardizing the manual process first?

Usually, when I see teams stuck on this, it's because the underlying template isn't consistent.

Happy to hop on a 5-min call to explain what I mean if that helps.

Best,

Jonah

## 5. The "Break Up" Email (Send after 2 weeks of silence)
**Subject:** Closing the file on [Workflow]?

Hi [Name],

I haven't heard back, so I assume [Workflow] automation isn't a priority right now.

I'm going to archive this file on my end so I don't keep pestering you.

If you ever decide you want to tackle that **$[Annual Amount]** leak, feel free to reach out. The PRACTICAL framework isn't going anywhere.

All the best,

Jonah
