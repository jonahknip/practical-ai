# Lead Qualification Criteria
*Don't waste time on Red Flags.*

---

## 🟢 GREEN FLAGS (Ideal Client)
*Move to Proposal immediately.*

1.  **Staff Count:** 20-200 employees. (Big enough to have pain, small enough to decide fast).
2.  **Role:** Engineering, Architecture, Environmental, or specialized Consulting.
3.  **The Pain:** They can name a specific, repetitive document or process that everyone hates (e.g., "Monthly Compliance Reports").
4.  **Multi-Location:** They have 2+ offices (Scalability is a huge selling point).
5.  **Awareness:** They know they are "behind" on tech but don't know where to start.
6.  **Champion:** They can name a specific person on their team who would love to help test this.

## 🟡 YELLOW FLAGS (Proceed with Caution)
*Dig deeper before proposing.*

1.  **Very Small (<10 people):** The ROI math is harder to prove.
    *   *Check:* Are they growing fast? If yes, sell "Scalability."
2.  **"Generative" Focus:** They want AI to write blog posts or marketing copy.
    *   *Check:* Pivot them to Operations. "Marketing is great, but let's look at your Ops cost."
3.  **IT Gatekeepers:** The IT Director is on the call and looks skeptical.
    *   *Check:* Emphasize security and "Human in the Loop" early. Use your Dev background to bond.
4.  **No Budget Authority:** You are talking to a junior associate.
    *   *Check:* "Who else needs to see this math to approve the project?"

## 🔴 RED FLAGS (Disqualify)
*Politely end the process.*

1.  **Consumer B2C:** (e.g., Restaurants, Retail). Your framework is for professional services.
2.  **Zero Budget:** "We are looking for a free trial."
3.  **"Magic Button" Mentality:** They expect AI to replace their engineers entirely.
4.  **Disorganized:** They can't even describe their current process. (You can't automate chaos).
5.  **Tech-Hostile:** "I don't trust computers." (Don't fight this battle).

## Disqualification Script
"Based on what you've told me, I don't think I'm the best fit for you right now. My framework works best for firms that have a structured process ready to automate. I'd recommend you [focus on standardizing your process manual] first, and then let's talk in 6 months."
