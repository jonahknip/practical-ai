# Discovery Questions Master List
*Pick and choose based on the flow. You don't need to ask all of these.*

---

## Category 1: The "Magic Wand" Questions (Openers)
*Use these to get them talking about pain.*

*   "In an ideal world, what is the one task your Project Managers would never have to do again?"
*   "Where do projects usually get stuck? Is it in the actual engineering work, or the admin/review coordination around it?"
*   "If you look at your team's timesheets, what's the 'Unbillable' code getting used for the most?"

## Category 2: The Process Excavation (Digging for Workflows)
*Use these when they mention a general problem (e.g., 'Reviews take too long').*

*   "Walk me through that. When a PM sits down to do a Review, what is the very first thing they do? ... And then what?"
*   "How many different software tools are they opening to do that one task?"
*   "Is that process written down, or is it just in everyone's heads?"
*   "How consistent is that process between your [City A] office and your [City B] office?" (Leverage your multi-office experience).

## Category 3: The "Billable Hour" Quantifiers (Getting the Numbers)
*You cannot calculate ROI without these answers.*

*   "How many people on your team are touching this specific workflow?"
*   "If you had to guess, how many hours per week per person is this eating up?"
*   "What is the average billable rate for the people doing this work?"
*   "How many projects go through this specific phase per month?"

## Category 4: The "Champion" Check (Implementation Readiness)
*Determining if they can actually adopt the solution.*

*   "If we were to automate this, who on your team would be the one to test it out? Do you have a 'tech-forward' PM?"
*   "At Abonmarche, we succeeded because we had internal champions. Do you have someone who is annoyed enough by this problem to help fix it?"
*   "How does your team generally handle new tech? Do they embrace it, or do they fight it?"

## Category 5: Decision & Budget (Closing)
*Finding out if they can buy.*

*   "We discussed that this problem is costing you roughly [$X] per year. Is fixing that a priority for this quarter?"
*   "Typically, a Pilot to fix a workflow like this runs between $12k-$18k. Is that a range you can approve if the ROI is there?"
*   "Who else besides you would need to see the math to sign off on a pilot?"

## "Landmine" Questions (What to avoid)
*   *Avoid:* "What is your AI strategy?" (Too vague, leads to theoretical debates).
*   *Avoid:* "What is your budget?" (Too early, leads to defensive answers. Use the bracket method in Category 5 instead).
