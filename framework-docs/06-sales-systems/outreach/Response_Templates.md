## 1. "Tell me more / Send me info"
**Goal:** Don't send a wall of text. Send value + ask for a call.

"Sure thing, [Name].

I put together a **One-Page Case Study** on how we saved $576k at Abonmarche. It breaks down the exact math:
**[Link to PDF]**

Basically, we identified one repetitive workflow (plan reviews), automated the checklist/compliance steps, and rolled it out to 10 PMs.

I'd love to run those numbers for [Company]. Are you free **Tuesday at 2pm**?"

## 2. "Not right now / We're too busy"
**Goal:** Keep the door open.

"Totally understand. The 'busy trap' is exactly what keeps most firms from fixing these efficiencies!

I'll respect your time and check back in a few months.

In the meantime, feel free to grab the checklist we used to identify the workflow: **[Link]**. Might be useful for your next planning session."

## 3. "How much does it cost?"
**Goal:** Give a range, but sell the Pilot.

"Great question.

We typically start with a **Quick Win Pilot** ($12k–$18k).
This automates ONE workflow in 30 days to prove the ROI.

If we scale to a full transformation (multiple workflows), it's usually in the $35k–$60k range.

But honestly, I don't want you to spend a dime unless the math works. Can we take 15 mins to calculate the potential savings first?"

## 4. "We tried AI and it didn't work."
**Goal:** Empathize and differentiate.

"I hear that a lot. Most 'AI' consulting is just ChatGPT tricks.

What we did at Abonmarche was strictly **workflow automation**. We didn't try to get AI to 'write engineering reports.' We used it to handle the repetitive formatting, data entry, and compliance checks that bore humans.

It's less about 'Artificial Intelligence' and more about 'Intelligent Automation.'

Happy to show you the difference if you're open to it."

## 5. "We're interested."
**Goal:** Book the call immediately.

"Glad to hear it.

Let's not overcomplicate it. Here is my calendar link:
**calendly.com/jonahknip/discovery**

Please grab a 30-min slot. If you can bring **one example** of a repetitive document/workflow you hate to the call, that would be perfect."
