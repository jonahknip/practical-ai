# Personalization Guide
*Don't be a robot. Spend 3 minutes per prospect.*

---

## 1. Where to Research
*   **LinkedIn Profile:** Check "About" section and "Activity."
*   **Company Website:** Look at "Services" and "Projects/Portfolio."
*   **Google News:** Search "Company Name + Contract" or "Company Name + Award."

## 2. What to Look For (Pain Clues)
*   **Hiring:** Are they hiring "Project Managers" or "Coordinators"? (Means they are busy).
*   **Growth:** "We just opened a new office in [City]." (Means they have consistency pain).
*   **Projects:** "Proud to announce we won the [Big Infrastructure] project." (Means they have volume pain).
*   **Tech Stack:** Do they list "Procore," "Bluebeam," or "Deltek"? (Means they are tech-aware).

## 3. How to Customize (The "First Line")

**Bad Personalization:**
"I see you went to [University]. Go [Mascot]!"
*(Everyone does this. It feels fake.)*

**Good Personalization (Business Relevance):**
"I saw [Company] just won the [Project Name] contract. Congrats—managing the review volume on that must be a beast."

**Good Personalization (Role Empathy):**
"I noticed you've been a PM at [Company] for 5 years. You've probably seen the admin workload creep up over that time."

**Good Personalization (Location):**
"I see you're based in [City]. We have an Abonmarche office near there—I know the regulatory environment in [State] adds a lot of paperwork."

## 4. The "Reason for Outreach" Bridge
*Always connect the observation to your solution.*

*   **Observation:** "You just won a big project."
*   **Bridge:** "That usually means PMs get buried in paperwork."
*   **Solution:** "I help automate that paperwork so they can focus on the project."
