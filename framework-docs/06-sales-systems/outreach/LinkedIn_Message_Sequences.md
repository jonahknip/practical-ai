## Sequence 1: The Connection Request
*Limit: 300 characters.*

**Option A (Industry Peer):**
"Hi [Name], I’m a developer at Abonmarche Consultants. I see we’re both in the [Industry] space. I’m sharing how we used AI to save $576k/year on plan reviews—thought you might find the case study interesting. Would love to connect."

**Option B (Pain Point):**
"Hi [Name], noticed you’re managing the team at [Company]. I help engineering firms automate repetitive admin work to recover billable hours (saved Abonmarche $576k last year). Would love to connect and share notes."

## Sequence 2: The "Welcome" (After they accept)
*Do not pitch yet. Offer value.*

"Thanks for connecting, [Name].

I put together a short breakdown of how we automated our plan review workflow at Abonmarche (11 offices). It saved our PMs about 4 hours per project.

Here it is if you're curious: **[Link to One-Pager Case Study]**

Let me know if that resonates with what you're seeing at [Company]."

## Sequence 3: The "Value" & Ask (3-5 days later)
*Pivot to a conversation.*

"Hi [Name] - quick question.

Does your team spend a lot of time on repetitive [Industry] tasks like compliance checks or report generation?

We found that was the biggest leak in our billable hours.

If you're open to it, I'd love to run a quick ROI calculation with you to see how much capacity you could recover. No pressure, just math.
