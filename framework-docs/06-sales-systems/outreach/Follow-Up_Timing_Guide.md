# Follow-Up Timing Guide
*Persistence pays, but don't be annoying.*

## Standard Cadence (The "3-Step Email")

*   **Day 0:** Send Email 1 (The Hook).
*   **Day 3:** Send Email 2 (The Proof).
    *   *Why:* Keeps you top of mind without looking desperate.
*   **Day 7:** Send Email 3 (The Breakup/Ask).
    *   *Why:* One week later gives them time to clear their inbox.

## The Omni-Channel Approach (Email + LinkedIn)

*   **Day 0:** Send LinkedIn Connection Request (Custom note).
*   **Day 1:** If accepted, send LinkedIn "Welcome" message.
    *   *If NOT accepted:* Send Email 1.
*   **Day 4:** Send Email 2 (Case Study).
*   **Day 8:** Send LinkedIn Follow-up ("Did you see my email?").
*   **Day 12:** Send Email 3 (Breakup).

## When to Move On (Disqualification)

*   **No reply after 3 emails + 1 LinkedIn message:** Move to "Dead" status. Wait 3-6 months before trying again.
*   **Hard No ("Stop emailing me"):** Mark as "Do Not Contact." Respect it immediately.
*   **Soft No ("Not right now"):** Set a reminder for 3 months. Send a value-add email (e.g., new case study), not a sales pitch.

## Best Times to Send (Professional Services)

*   **Tuesday - Thursday:** Best days.
*   **Times:**
    *   **8:00 AM - 9:00 AM:** Catch them checking email before the day starts.
    *   **4:00 PM - 5:00 PM:** Catch them wrapping up admin work.
*   **Avoid:** Monday mornings (too busy) and Friday afternoons (checked out).
