## FINAL THOUGHTS

### Keys to Success

**1. Under-promise, Over-deliver**
Conservative estimates always. Exceed them.

**2. Measure Everything**
You can't improve what you don't measure.

**3. Champions Are Everything**
Invest heavily in them. They're your multiplier.

**4. Iterate Fast**
2-week sprints. Fail fast, learn faster.

**5. Sustainability Matters**
You're building a system, not creating dependency.

### Red Flags to Never Ignore

🚩 Client won't commit to success metrics
🚩 No executive sponsorship
🚩 Can't identify champions
🚩 Resistant to measurement
🚩 Unwilling to change any processes
🚩 Expects magic, not work

**If you see these, reconsider the engagement.**

### Your North Star

Every decision should pass this test:
"Does this help the client save time and operate independently?"

If yes → do it
If no → don't
