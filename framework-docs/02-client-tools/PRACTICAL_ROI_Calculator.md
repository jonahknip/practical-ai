($_____________ - $_____________) ÷ $_____________ × 100 = _______%
```

### 3-Year ROI

**Year 1 Benefit:** $_____________ - $_____________ (one-time) = $_____________

**Year 2 Benefit:** $_____________

**Year 3 Benefit:** $_____________

**Total 3-Year Benefit:** $_____________

**Total 3-Year Investment:** $_____________ (one-time) + ($_____________ × 3 years) = $_____________

**3-Year ROI:** 

```
(Total Benefit - Total Investment) ÷ Total Investment × 100

($_____________ - $_____________) ÷ $_____________ × 100 = _______%
```

## EXAMPLE CALCULATION

**Process:** Weekly sales report generation

**Current State:**
- 3 people spend 4 hours each per week
- Average hourly rate: $45
- 52 weeks per year
- Current annual cost: 3 × 4 × 52 × $45 = **$28,080/year**

**With AI:**
- Same 3 people spend 1 hour each per week (75% reduction)
- New annual cost: 3 × 1 × 52 × $45 = **$7,020/year**
- **Annual savings: $21,060**

**Implementation Costs:**
- Consulting: $8,000
- Software: $50/month = $600/year
- Training: 6 hours × $45 = $270
- **Total one-time: $8,270**
- **Annual ongoing: $600**

**ROI Analysis:**
- Net annual benefit: $21,060 - $600 = **$20,460**
- Payback period: $8,270 ÷ $20,460 = **0.4 years (5 months)** ✓
- Year 1 ROI: ($20,460 - $8,270) ÷ $8,870 = **137%**
- 3-Year ROI: **632%**

**Decision: PROCEED - Excellent ROI with fast payback**
