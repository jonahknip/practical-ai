## COMMON QUESTIONS

### "Can I really charge $12K-$60K?"

Yes, if you deliver the value. Your services save clients $50K-$150K+ annually. They're getting a great deal.

### "What if I don't have enterprise experience?"

You have real implementation experience. You've done this at your current company. That's more valuable than theoretical knowledge.

### "Should I quit my job to do this?"

NO. Start as side work. Land 1-2 clients. Build cash reserves (6-12 months). THEN consider full-time.

### "What if a client asks for something I can't do?"

Be honest. Say "That's outside my expertise, but I can help you find someone" or "Let me research that and get back to you."

### "How do I handle technical questions?"

You know enough. For edge cases: "Great question. Let me research the best approach and present options tomorrow."
