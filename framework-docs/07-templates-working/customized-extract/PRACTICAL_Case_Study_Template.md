## EXAMPLE: REAL CASE STUDY

### CASE STUDY: Regional Engineering Firm
**How a 4-Office Engineering Firm Saved 62% on Report Generation**

**Industry:** Civil Engineering & GIS
**Company Size:** 87 employees across 4 offices
**Location:** Multi-state (US)
**Project Duration:** 8 weeks (pilot) + 6 weeks (full rollout)
**Investment:** $28,000
**ROI:** 1,678% (Year 1)

---

### THE CHALLENGE

A regional civil engineering firm with 4 offices was drowning in manual report generation. Each office had different processes, leading to inconsistent quality and excessive time spent on administrative work instead of billable client projects.

**Specific Issues:**
- Report generation took 27 hours per week across all offices
- Inconsistent formatting between offices
- 15% error rate requiring rework
- Engineers spending 30% of time on non-billable admin work
- Client deliverable delays averaging 3-5 days

**What They'd Tried:**
- Standardized templates (not followed consistently)
- Hired admin staff (couldn't understand technical content)
- Paid overtime (unsustainable cost)

**The Tipping Point:**
"We lost a major client because we couldn't deliver reports on time. That $180K annual contract loss got everyone's attention."
— Director of Operations

---

### THE PRACTICAL APPROACH

**Discovery Phase:**
- Shadowed 12 employees across 4 offices
- Documented 23 distinct report types
- Identified report generation as #1 pain point (Score: 94/100)

**The Numbers:**
- Current: 12 people × 2.25 hours/week = 27 hours/week
- Annual cost: 27 × 52 × $55/hr = $77,220/year
- Projected savings: $47,580/year (62% reduction)
- Payback: 7 months

---

### THE SOLUTION

**Tools:** ChatGPT API + Python + existing GIS software

**Implementation:**
- Week 1-2: Built AI-powered report generation system
- Week 3-4: Pilot with 3 engineers (1 per office)
- Week 5-6: Refined and expanded to 12 users
- Week 7-8: Full rollout with training

**The Workflow:**

**Before:**
1. Extract data from GIS manually (45 min)
2. Create charts in Excel (30 min)
3. Write report narrative (60 min)
4. Format in Word (20 min)
5. QA review (30 min)
**Total: 185 minutes**

**After:**
1. Export GIS data (5 min)
2. AI generates report with charts (automated, 2 min)
3. Engineer reviews and refines (30 min)
4. Final QA (15 min)
**Total: 50 minutes (73% reduction)**

---

### THE RESULTS

**90-Day Results:**
- Time saved: 19.7 hours/week (vs 16.7 projected)
- Actual savings: $56,316/year
- Adoption: 92% (11 of 12 regularly using)
- Error rate: 3% (down from 15%)
- Client satisfaction: +23%

**Unexpected Benefits:**
1. Consistent formatting across all offices
2. Engineers now use AI for proposal writing too
3. Won back the lost client with faster turnaround

**Client Quote:**
"This paid for itself in 5 months. We're now the fastest firm in our market for deliverables. That's become our competitive advantage."
— Principal Engineer

**Year 1 ROI:** 101% (even with conservative estimates)

**3-Year Projection:** $169,000 total savings on $28,000 investment = 504% ROI
