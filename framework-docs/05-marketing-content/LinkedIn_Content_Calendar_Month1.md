## Week 1 — Establish "Self-Taught" credibility + tell the “one workflow” story

### Post 1
**DATE:** Week 1, Monday
**POST TYPE:** Origin Story / Positioning
**GOAL:** Establish yourself as the "everyday person who figured it out"

**POST TEXT:**
I'm not a developer.

I'm a GIS Technician who taught myself to use AI tools to save my company $576K in 90 days.

No Computer Science degree.
No coding bootcamp.
Just AI tools and persistence.

Here's what happened:

I work at Abonmarche Consultants (200+ employees, 11 offices). I grew up around engineering firms, so I understood the workflows. But I wasn't technical in the traditional sense.

One day I had a goal: Use AI to make my work 10x faster.

So I started teaching myself. Claude for strategy. ChatGPT for problem-solving. AI tools to build things I didn't know how to code manually.

In 90 days, I:
- Automated our civil engineering plan review process
- Saved the company $576,000 annually
- Recovered 240-320 billable hours per month
- Reduced PM administrative time by 60%

But here's what really mattered:

I taught 10 Project Managers - none of them "developers" - to use AI tools themselves.

They went from "I can't do this" to solving their own workflow problems.

That's when I realized:

Everyone's trying to figure out how to use AI to work 10x faster.

I already figured it out.

And if a non-developer like me can teach myself - and teach 10 non-technical PMs - anyone can learn this.

That's what I do now. I teach teams to use AI tools to build systems 10x faster than they could manually.

Not "implement AI for you."
Teach you to do it yourself.

Capability, not dependency.

If this resonates, comment "CAPABILITY" and I'll share how I did it.

**HASHTAGS:** #AI #SelfTaught #Capability #FutureOfWork #NoTraditionalPath

**ENGAGEMENT STRATEGY:**
- Reply to every "CAPABILITY" comment with: "DMing you the breakdown"
- DM them your one-liner + discovery call link
- Engage with 15 similar posts today
- Share your origin story authentically
- Position as relatable, not expert

### Post 2
**DATE:** Week 1, Wednesday
**POST TYPE:** Results / Proof
**GOAL:** Show the specific ROI with "non-developer" angle

**POST TEXT:**
"You're not a real developer. How did you save your company $576K?"

Great question. Let me show you the math.

At Abonmarche, our PMs were spending 4 billable hours per project on administrative review tasks.

Engineers: another 4 hours per project.

At $225/hr (PM) and $150/hr (Engineer):
- PM waste: 4 hours × $225 = $900/project
- Engineer waste: 4 hours × $150 = $600/project
- Total: $1,500/project in pure administrative overhead

With 10 PMs running ~40 projects per month:
- 40 projects × $1,500 = $60,000/month wasted
- $60,000 × 12 months = $720,000/year

I automated the review workflow using AI tools (not manual coding).

Conservative savings: $1,200 per project
- 40 projects × $1,200 = $48,000/month
- $48,000 × 12 = $576,000/year

Did I write everything from scratch? No.
Did I need a CS degree? No.
Did I use AI tools to build 10x faster? Yes.

The best part?

I taught 10 PMs (none of them "technical") to use the same tools.

Now they solve their own problems.

Here's the thing people miss:

You don't need to be a "real developer" anymore.

You need to know how to use AI tools effectively.

I proved this at a 200-person company.
Your team can do it too.

What workflow is eating your billable hours?

**HASHTAGS:** #AI #ROI #BillableHours #ProfessionalServices #Automation

**ENGAGEMENT STRATEGY:**
- Reply to workflow mentions with quick ROI estimates
- Ask follow-up questions: "How many people touch this? How often?"
- DM the most engaged commenters
- Show you can calculate ROI on the spot
- Position as practical problem-solver, not theorist

### Post 3
**DATE:** Week 1, Friday
**POST TYPE:** Mindset / Permission
**GOAL:** Give people permission to try

**POST TEXT:**
The barrier to using AI isn't technical skill.

It's permission.

You think: "I'm not a developer. I can't do this."

I'm here to tell you: Yes, you can.

I'm a GIS Technician.
No CS degree.
No bootcamp.
No formal training.

I taught myself to use AI tools by solving one problem at a time.

The result: $576K saved in 90 days.

Here's what I learned:

You don't need to master everything.
You need to solve ONE problem.

You don't need to code from scratch.
You need to use AI tools effectively.

You don't need years of experience.
You need clarity on what you're trying to solve.

At Abonmarche, I trained 10 Project Managers.
None of them "technical."
None of them thought they could do this.

Now they automate their own workflows.

The shift from "I can't" to "I can" took one successful project.

That's it.

One workflow automated.
One problem solved.
One proof point that this is possible.

Then everything changes.

So here's my question for you:

What ONE problem could you solve if you knew it was possible?

Not every problem.
Just ONE.

Comment below. Let's talk through it.

Because if I can teach myself - and teach 10 non-technical PMs - you can learn this too.

**HASHTAGS:** #AI #Mindset #YouCanDoThis #SelfTaught #GrowthMindset

**ENGAGEMENT STRATEGY:**
- Reply thoughtfully to every problem mentioned
- Give specific, actionable suggestions
- Build rapport and trust
- Show you're a teacher, not a salesperson
- DM the most engaged people with discovery call offer
