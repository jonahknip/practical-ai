**R** - ROI Reality Check: Real numbers or we don't recommend it  
**A** - Accessible Entry Point: Start small, prove value fast
**C** - Champion Cultivation: Your team leads adoption, not consultants
**T** - Tool-Agnostic: We recommend what works, not what we sell
**I** - Iterative Implementation: 2-week sprints, continuous improvement
**C** - Change Management: Address psychology, not just technology
**A** - Analytics & Accountability: Measure everything
**L** - Legacy Integration: Work with your existing systems

### What Makes Us Different

| Traditional AI Consulting | PRACTICAL Approach |
|---------------------------|-------------------|
| 6-12 month timelines | 30-90 day results |

## RISK MITIGATION

### Common Implementation Risks

**Risk:** Team resists adoption
**Mitigation:** Champion-led peer influence, quick wins build momentum, address "job threat" fears directly

**Risk:** Technical integration challenges
**Mitigation:** We work with your existing systems (no forced overhauls), pilot tests integration before full rollout

**Risk:** ROI doesn't materialize
**Mitigation:** Conservative projections, measurement from Day 1, iterative approach allows course correction

**Risk:** Consultant dependency
**Mitigation:** Knowledge transfer from start, your team drives adoption, documentation ensures sustainability

**Risk:** Tools don't fit workflows
**Mitigation:** Shadow real work before recommending tools, tool-agnostic approach, can switch if needed

### Our Guarantee

**If we don't achieve measurable ROI within 6 months of full implementation, you receive a full refund of consulting fees.**

We've never paid out because PRACTICAL works when implemented as designed.
