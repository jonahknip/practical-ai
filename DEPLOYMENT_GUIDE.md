# PRACTICAL AI WEBSITE DEPLOYMENT GUIDE

## 1. WHAT WAS FOUND
We located the full React source code generated by Manus at:
`/Users/jonahknip/Projects/8th-wonder-website`

## 2. WHAT WAS DONE
I successfully **compiled and built** the production-ready website for you.
The deployable files are now located in:
`/Users/jonahknip/Projects/8th-wonder-website/dist`

## 3. RECOMMENDED DEPLOYMENT METHOD (Netlify)
**Fastest way to go live (2 minutes):**

1.  **Open Netlify:** Go to [netlify.com](https://netlify.com) and log in.
2.  **Add New Site:** Click "Add new site" > "Deploy manually".
3.  **Locate the Folder:** Open Finder on your Mac and navigate to:
    `/Users/jonahknip/Projects/8th-wonder-website`
4.  **Upload:** Drag and drop the **`dist`** folder (inside `8th-wonder-website`) onto the Netlify drop zone.
    *   *Critical:* Do NOT drag the whole project folder. Only drag the `dist` folder.
5.  **Rename:** Once uploaded, go to "Site settings" > "Change site name" and pick `practical-ai-jonah.netlify.app` (or similar).

## 4. ALTERNATIVE: STATIC HTML (Backup)
If for any reason the React site isn't what you want, I can generate a simple, single-file HTML page. But the React build succeeded, so that is the higher-quality option.

## 5. FILE TO UPLOAD
**Path:** `/Users/jonahknip/Projects/8th-wonder-website/dist`
**Type:** Folder
**Method:** Drag and drop to Netlify

## 6. VERIFICATION CHECKLIST
After deployment, verify:
- [ ] Site loads without "Page Not Found" errors
- [ ] Images (logo, etc.) are visible
- [ ] "Book Call" buttons link to Calendly
- [ ] Mobile responsiveness works

---
**Ready to deploy.**
