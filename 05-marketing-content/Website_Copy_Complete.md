### [SECTION 2: THE STORY]
*(Visual: Your headshot or a photo of you working)*

**Headline:**
**How an Everyday GIS Technician Saved His Company $576K**

**Body Copy:**
I grew up around engineering consulting firms. I understood the workflows, the pain points, the repetitive tasks eating up billable hours.

But I wasn't a "real developer." No Computer Science degree. No formal training. Just a GIS Technician who learned what I needed, when I needed it.

One day I had a simple goal: Use AI to make my work 10x faster.

Not to become an expert.
Not to master every tool.
Just to get better results with less effort.

So I started teaching myself. Using Claude for strategy. Using AI tools to build things I didn't know how to code manually. Trial and error. Figure it out as I go.

**The result?**

In 90 days, I:
- Automated the civil engineering plan review process at **Abonmarche** (200+ employees, 11 offices)
- Saved the company **$576,000 annually**
- Recovered 240-320 billable hours per month
- Reduced PM administrative time by 60%

But here's what really mattered:

**I taught 10 Project Managers - none of them technical - to use AI tools themselves.**

They went from "I can't do this" to "I can solve my own problems."

That's when I realized: Everyone's trying to figure out how to use AI to work 10x faster.

I already figured it out.

And if I can teach myself - and teach 10 non-technical PMs - I can teach anyone.

That's what I do now.

### [SECTION 3: THE PROBLEM]
*(Visual: "Old Way" crossed out)*

**Headline:**
**The Old Way Doesn't Work Anymore**

**Body Copy:**
The traditional approach to AI:

❌ Hire expensive consultants ($200K+ budgets)
❌ Wait 12 months for results
❌ Become dependent on "experts"
❌ Never build internal capability
❌ Watch consultants leave with all the knowledge

This creates a cycle:
**Problem → Hire expert → Expert solves it → New problem → Hire expert again**

You never become capable. You stay dependent.

There's a better way.

### [SECTION 4: THE NEW WAY]
*(Visual: "New Way" highlighted)*

**Headline:**
**The NEW Way: Build Capability, Not Dependency**

**Body Copy:**
What if instead of hiring someone to implement AI "for" you...

You learned to use AI tools to solve your own problems?

What if instead of depending on consultants...

Your team became AI-capable themselves?

This isn't theoretical. This is what I did at Abonmarche.

I didn't just automate a workflow.
**I taught 10 PMs to use AI tools themselves.**

Now they can:
- Identify automation opportunities
- Use AI tools to solve problems
- Build solutions without "real developers"
- Keep improving processes independently

**The result:**
✅ One automated workflow ($576K savings)
✅ Ten capable people (infinite potential)

That's the difference between dependency and capability.

### [SECTION 5: THE PROOF]
*(Visual: Stats box)*

**Headline:**
**Proof This Works (From Someone Who Isn't Even a 'Real' Developer)**

**Body Copy:**
At **Abonmarche Consultants** (200+ employees, 11 offices), I:

**IMPLEMENTED:**
- Automated the civil engineering design review process (30%/60%/90%/Final phases)
- Across 11 offices, for 10 Project Managers
- In 90 days (pilot to full rollout)

**SAVED:**
- **$576,000 annually** in recovered billable capacity
- 1-2 hours per project per review phase
- 240-320 billable hours per month total
- Minimum $500-$5,000 per project in administrative waste

**TAUGHT:**
- 10 Project Managers (non-technical) to use AI tools themselves
- 85%+ adoption rate across the organization
- Peer-to-peer learning model (champions teaching others)
- Sustainable capability (they don't need me anymore)

**THE KICKER:**
I did this without being a "traditional developer."
I'm a GIS Technician who taught myself to use AI tools effectively.

If I can do it, your team can too.

This was **ONE** workflow.
Imagine what your team could do with 5 more.

**Headline:**
**How I'm Different: I Teach, Not Just Implement**

| Traditional Consultant | Enterprise AI Firm | Me (PRACTICAL AI) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Implements "for" you | Transforms everything | **Teaches your team** |
| Dependency model | Requires replacement | **Capability model** |
| You pay forever | 12-month timelines | **You become self-sufficient** |
| "Trust the experts" | $200K+ budgets | **"You can do this"** |

### [SECTION 8: WHO THIS IS FOR]
*(Visual: Checkmark list)*

**Headline:**
**Is This Right For Your Team?**

**YES, if you:**
✅ Have 20-200 employees (not enterprise, not tiny).
✅ Lose billable hours to repetitive administrative work.
✅ Have workflows that repeat weekly/daily.
✅ Want your team capable, not consultant-dependent.
✅ Are tired of paying experts to solve every problem.
✅ Have some budget but not $200K for enterprise consultants.
✅ Need results in weeks, not years.
✅ Want practical solutions, not buzzwords.

**NO, if you:**
❌ Want someone to do everything for you forever.
❌ Don't want your team to learn new things.
❌ Need enterprise-scale transformation.
❌ Prefer dependency over capability.
❌ Want to hire "experts" to stay in control.

### [SECTION 9: FAQ]
*(Visual: Accordion style if possible, or simple list)*

**Q: Wait, you're not a "real" developer?**
A: Nope. I'm a GIS Technician who taught myself to use AI tools effectively. I have no CS degree, no bootcamp, no formal training. Just someone who figured out how to use Claude, ChatGPT, and other AI tools to build systems 10x faster than I could manually. And if I can teach myself - and teach 10 non-technical PMs at my company - I can teach your team too.

**Q: If you're not a developer, how did you save your company $576K?**
A: That's exactly the point. You DON'T need to be a traditional developer anymore. With AI tools, non-technical people can solve problems that used to require years of coding experience. I proved this at scale - 11 offices, 10 PMs, all non-technical, all now AI-capable. That's what I teach.

**Q: Will we become dependent on you?**
A: The opposite. My goal is to make you self-sufficient. I teach your team to use AI tools themselves, not just implement solutions "for" you. By the end, you won't need me anymore. That's the point. Capability, not dependency.

**Q: What if our team "isn't technical"?**
A: Perfect. That's my specialty. I'm not technical either (in the traditional sense). I teach normal people to use AI tools. The 10 PMs I trained at Abonmarche weren't technical. They're now solving their own automation problems. If they can do it, your team can too.

**Q: How is this different from hiring a developer?**
A: Traditional developers write code from scratch. I teach your team to use AI tools to build solutions. It's faster, cheaper, and more sustainable. Plus, your team learns the capability - they're not dependent on one developer. It's the new way of working.
